Martin Connor Sexton Junior Developer Portfolio a Typescript React Project

Overview:

In this project I aimed to create a website that is showcases my progress towards becoming a web developer as well as showcasing my CV.

Technical Features: 

- Multi-page application through the use of createBrowserRoute with the inclusion of an error page using useRouteError.
- The site makes use of several of React's hooks including useState and useParams.
- The site's format changes for different screen sizes.

Enhancement ideas: 

- Review fonts
- Media queries for dark and light mode 
- Video introduction on the about page
- Link scroll issue on the CV page (arrive half way down the page)
- Translation into other languages can impact formatting
- Improve accessibility with the use of buttons
